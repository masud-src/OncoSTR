# OncoSTR
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) 

OncoSTR is a **str**uctural segmentation package for medical images that are distorted due to a **onco**logical disease.
To perform the segmentation processes, the fast algorithm of fsl [1] is used. This algorithm builds on a k-means 
clustering and compares probability-intensity gaussian functions of the different compartments. To take account of the
distorted area, two different approaches are presented. For this purpose, a previously created tumour segmentation is 
used and the identified areas are treated separately. The exact procedure is explained in more detail in Suditsch et 
al. [2], but some exemplary results are shown in the following.

## Examplary results

The first image shows the tumor agnostic mode, where the images are simply segmented with fsl's fast algorithm, without
any preparation.

Since both presented approaches cut the healthy brain area and segment it separately, the next image holds for both.
Here only the segmented brain is shown.

The next image shows the *bias corrected* mode. In short, herein the tumour area is cut and and both (healthy and tumor)
images are segmented with fsl's fast algorithm separately.

</p>
Finally, the last images show the *tumor entity weighted* mode. Herein, the tumour area is again cut from the healthy
brain tissue and it is taken advantage of the distinct compartments of the tumour. Therefore, it is separated again into
the particular classes of the tumour segmentation (according to BraTS into edema, active and necrotic core). In this
areas the gray scale of the image is normalised.

## Integration of OncoSTR
OncoSTR is part of a module based umbrella software project for numerical simulations of patient-specific cancer 
diseases, see following figure. From given input states of medical images the disease is modelled and its evolution is 
simulated giving possible predictions. In this way, a digital cancer patient is created, which could be used as a basis for 
further research, as a decision-making tool for doctors in diagnosis and treatment and as an additional illustrative 
demonstrator for enabling patients understand their individual disease. All parts resolve to an open-access framework, 
that is ment to be an accelerator for the digital cancer patient. Each module can be installed and run independently. 
The current state of development comprises the following modules

- OncoFEM (https://github.com/masud-src/OncoFEM)
- OncoGEN (https://github.com/masud-src/OncoGEN)
- OncoTUM (https://github.com/masud-src/OncoTUM)
- OncoSTR (https://github.com/masud-src/OncoSTR)

## Software availability

You can either follow the installation instruction below or use the already pre-installed virtual boxes via the 
following Links:

- Version 1.0:  https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3720

## Installation and Machine Requirements

There are two different options the installation can be done. First, is the stand-alone installation, where OncoSTR is
simply installed in an Anaconda environment. The other way is to install OncoFEM (https://github.com/masud-src/OncoFEM) 
first and add the missing packets. This installation was tested on a virtual box created with a linux mint 21.2 
cinnamon, 64 bit system and 8 GB RAM on a local machine (intel cpu i7-9700k with 3.6 GHz, 128 GB RAM).

### Stand-alone installation

To ensure, the system is ready, it is first updated, upgraded and basic packages are installed via apt.
````bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential python3-pip git
````
- Anaconda needs to be installed. Go to https://anaconda.org/ and follow the installation instructions.
- Run the following command to set up an anaconda environment for oncostr by pressing 2 in the system dialog.
````bash
git clone https://github.com/masud-src/OncoSTR/
cd OncoSTR
python3 create_conda_environment.py
conda activate oncostr
````
- Run the following line or download the fsl package from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation and
  install in preferred directory, ensure that oncostr environment is activated.
````bash
curl -O https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslinstaller.py
python3 fslinstaller.py
````
- Finally install OncoSTR on the local system.
````bash
python3 -m pip install .
````
- The package can now be used. To test the correct installation, run a python script with the following code line.
````bash
import oncostr
````

### Install on existing OncoFEM environment

- Run the following command which adds packages to the existing Anaconda environment by pressing 1 in the system dialog.
````bash
git clone https://github.com/masud-src/OncoSTR/
cd OncoSTR
python3 create_conda_environment.py
conda activate oncofem
````
- Run the following line or download the fsl package from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation and
  install in preferred directory, ensure that oncofem environment is activated.
````bash
curl -O https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslinstaller.py
python fslinstaller.py
````
- Finally install oncostr on the local system.
````bash
python3 -m pip install .
````
- The package can now be used. To test the correct installation, run a python script with the following code line.
````bash
import oncostr
````

## Tutorial

There is an tutorial for the umbrella software project provided on DaRUS 
(https://darus.uni-stuttgart.de/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18419/darus-3679). You can download and run the
tutorial_structure_segmentation.py file by run the following lines in your desired directory.
````bash
curl --output tutorial.zip https:/darus.uni-stuttgart.de/api/access/dataset/:persistentId/?persistentId=doi:10.18419/darus-3679
unzip tutorial.zip
tar -xvzf tutorial.tar.gz
rm tutorial.tar.gz tutorial.zip
````

## How To

You can modify the existing algorithms, respectively expand the existing by your own. Therefore, you can fork and ask 
for pull requests.
